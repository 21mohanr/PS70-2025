<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are some ideas for my final project. I looked through lots of old projects and thought about what
could be both manageable and interesting.
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Subwoofer with bass control</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I like electronic music but have sometimes found the bass on speakers that are commercially sold to be subpar. As such,
I could build my own subwoofer that controls the bass level. On the base level, the project would include some cutting and
designing of the enclosure (a box of sorts), but it could also have touch sensors or microphone sensors for increased
user interaction. I am a bit struggling to understand how microcontroller programming fits into this project, but that might
be because I don't actually know what microcontroller programming consists of! The idea at its core is just to create a
subwoofer that the user can turn up or turn down bass level as they desire. 
An example of a box that could serve as the enclosure is below.

<h4>Idea 2: Motion-sensing alarm clock</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

As a serial snoozer of my alarm clock (which happens to be my phone), I am frustrated by the amount of effort necessary
to actually snooze. I have to fumble around for where my phone actually is, press snooze, and repeat the process when I want
to snooze again. Instead, the idea would be to create an alarm clock that responds to motions such as waving or other
disturbances. This way, when I get close to the area of the alarm clock, I can simply turn it off without exactly 
knowing its location or physically touching it.

<h4>Idea 3: Smart lamp</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

On our phones, we have functions that dynamically adjust brightness based on surroundings and time of day. But other light
sources, such as lamps in our room, do not have automatic functions and instead need to be adjusted manually or turned off.
But why not have a lamp that becomes brighter in dimmer areas and shines less in brighter areas, thus saving electricity
and manual work? The project would involve the creation of the physical structure of the lamp but also could use light
sensors and such. How fancy the project could go (what type of light, user interaction features, etc.) may depend more on time.
Below is a gif that I found online of a possibility, though much would have to be amended.
