  Hey everyone! My name is Rishi Mohan, and I am a senior in Mather House concentrating in Applied Math
  (with a focus in economics). I am originally from Dallas, TX, and am taking this class because building things
  and making tangible creations seems super interesting/fulfilling but is something I have absolutely no experience with. 
  From cutting things to robotics to whatever else we cover in this class, I am eager to absorb all the new knowledge 
  in the class and get to know all of you better.

  Outside of class, I am involved with the water polo team, the undergraduate law review, a PBHA program, and other clubs
  for fun. Other things I am a fan of are memes, detective shows, EDM, pro sports (NBA, F1, and soccer specifically), and 
  keeping up with current events.

I couldn't find photos of me doing anything science-y/tech-y, so here's my LinkedIn profile photo instead (always on the grind)

To make up for that boring photo above (and to prove I'm not a bot), here's some wise words from Bubb Rubb.
